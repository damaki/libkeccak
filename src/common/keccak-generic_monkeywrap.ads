--  @summary
--  Generic implementation of the MonkeyWrap construction.
--
--  @description
--  MonkeyWrap is an authenticated encryption scheme built on MonkeyDuplex.
--  Ketje variants are instantiations of this package.
--
--  This API is used as follows:
--
--  1 Call Init, providing a secret encryption key and a unique
--    "number used once" (nonce).
--
--  2 Optionally call Update_Auth_Data zero or more times to provide
--    arbitrary-length additional data that is authenticated, but
--    is not encrypted.
--
--  3 Optionally call Update_Encrypt or Update_Decrypt (but not both)
--    zero or more times to encrypt/decrypt arbitrary-length data.
--
--  4 Optionally call Extract_Tag or Verify_Tag (but not both)
--    zero or more times to get or check an arbitrary-length
--    authentication tag respectively.
--
--  Ketje supports the concept of sessions, where sequences of messages
--  can be authenticated rather than a single message. The first session is
--  initialised by loading the key and nonce. At the end of each message,
--  the New_Session procedure can be called to begin a new session, which
--  puts the Context back to step 2 above.
